Amazon_Warehouse_Process_Assistant_Pros_and_Cons,"Welcome back for another video so we are going to get into the process assistant pros and cons my experience let's go now listen there is no greater sight for your eyes to behold at an amazon warehouse than a process assistant in its full glory operating in its natural habitat all right all right all right i know i sound a little biased when it comes to this so pas are a major key when it comes to a success of the team also it's a big thing when it comes to the downfall of a team pas play a major role let's talk about it honestly the pa position i would have to say has been my favorite position so far working at amazon. 
I've been a tier one um i've been a store been a packer been an ambassador hit the dock you're not talking about the dock and now in corporate and i truly think i give my favorite position to this role the process assistant now i've been getting a lot of comments of some of you guys like man i want to go for that position but i'm nervous um i don't know what to expect in an interview listen there's nothing to be afraid of if you want to go for it i think this is the perfect position to go for i passed my interview the first time it took me seven months to get this position was i nervous yes but somebody gave me some great information um it's one of my mentors at amazon they was like listen if they're giving you the interview they're most likely looking for reasons to incline you then they are looking for reasons to decline you so keep that in mind if you're getting the interview most likely they want to see you succeed and with that being said 
We're going to start off with the pros so the first pro is you do not have to wait two years to get this position if you're coming to amazon for the opportunity that amazon brings with the all the growth that they have this position you don't have to wait two years me personally i could have had it at five months over the six months five or six months but my manager wanted me to go to the dock and get it over there i looked over the railing from floor 2 on stowe like yeah nah i'm cool i'ma stay up here it took me a few more months to get the position in the area that i wanted instead of going to the dock in a position that i didn't want it in so you do not have to wait two years to get this position there's honestly no time limit on how quick you can get it so that's definitely a pro and the next pro is following up with that 
You do not need a degree to get in this position not only do you not need a degree you can have terrible work history no past work history but you can come into amazon and get into this position despite that with no degree terrible work history no schooling you could have dropped out of school and you can get this position that is a super pro i've personally seen people who had terrible work history but they've come to amazon for the opportunity shaped up their attitude at amazon and stepped into this role within five to six months and are killing it this can be your first job you come in and execute you can't get into this position that's a pro in my book so the next pro 
This is also something that you get as a regular tier one but you do get your six month pay raise every six months pay raise pay raise pay raise pay raise pay me pay me pay me so even though you've left the tier one and you have entered into tier three you still get your pay raises it's not like you lose that that will still be increasing every six months that's definitely a pro now this next pro that is the away team yes you can go on no way teams as a pa not only as a problem solver and a learning ambassador as a pa you can also go on an away team that is fire if you have not gone to an away team once you're done with this video i'm gonna leave one of my other videos talking about my experience and away team they pay for your flight they pay for your hotel they pay for your gas they pay for your food they pay you're going to a whole new building you're launching it and as a tier three you'll be training other process assistants in this new building and you most likely gonna be training ams and ops managers and all this other stuff as well but it's so dope definitely take
advantage of that that is a business trip what other jobs you get paid business trips on nowadays that's a pro so this next pro i've talked about it before the freedom that you get in this position especially if you execute you can literally have no one peeping over your shoulder watching your every move you can go here you can go there you're in this station you're in that station you're on this floor you're on that floor as long as you're keeping the work standard or whatever that is in your department you're hitting your quotes you're handling business the freedom that you get in this position is super dope that's one of the things that i love you don't have to stay at your snow station all day or your pack station all day and that's a pro in my book all right so as a tier 3 i think this is a pro the overtime not only are you getting paid more on your overtime because you get paid more but when you come in to do work on overtime you're coming in as a regular associate you don't always have to run shift you can if you're an inbound in your pa on your overtime days you can just stow so you'll be stowing making a pa's pay rate or if you're a packer you're a pack pa you can go in on your overtime days and be packing and be making pa pay rate that is super dope alright so the next pro for the process assistant is the pay cap so you get a higher pay cap than you would as a tier one tier one two years you're maxing out on your pay cap on your pay rate your tier three two years you're maxing out as well but you're maxing out at a higher pay rate because you get paid more so that's definitely a pro you can have a higher pay cap a higher pay rate in the long run all right one of the other pros it is the experience you're doing everything that the area manager above you is doing you basically are going to learn the l4 job and how to run a floor you're going to get all the experiences to l4 by being the l3 so especially if you plan on moving up in the company get up out of there quick go to that five and six quick you plan on being that l5 l6 l7 this is your career if you are here because uncle jeff has chosen you to serve in the amazon the pa position is great because you'll definitely get that learning experience on how to run a floor and how to be an am before you even get into that position so the cons first one we're going to start off with call number one if you are not a people person this may not be the best position that you want to shoot for because everything that you're doing is engaging with associates coaching your gate engaging with associates um training staffing um everything you have to talk to people so if you do not like to talk to people you're not a people person it may be a little challenging for you and that may be a con in your book also when it comes to getting promoted to the tier three being a people person is important every single tier three that i have seen is low key like they were chosen before they were hired for that position they're usually prepped before they become a pa look in your own building most of the pas were pgs before were ambassadors before so if you're not a people person and you don't get along with your team or your manager and all that then it may be a little difficult for you just being honest but it will not stop you you can still get around that you can go to job finder submit your resume on your own and go to a different department or try to get a slot at a different building i've seen that done as well it can be done so another con is if you are in school or you have another part-time job this position is demanding i think this is a one-job position if you try to do this with two jobs you crazy but it can be done if you're in school it may be a challenge for you because this job is demanding this is a key role in the process of your department even though it may not be acknowledged as that and they may try to downplay that the pa role is critical and there's two ways to look at this on how if you're in school or another job how this will impact you if you're in school it's going to impact you because it's so demanding at work it may cause you to lose sleep in which will affect your studies which can ultimately affect the reason why you're going to school your long term goal or your long-term career is that worth it that's something that you have to be the judge about so if you're in school the pa position
may not be for you but i've seen people get it done i've seen people thrive in this position while going to school but it could be a con because it will be time consuming and it is demanding so another con for me personally learning all the tools i was an ambassador before i came into the process assistant and i was already doing some of the things when it came to the coaching and the engagement and leading the team was already making an impact in my department before i became a tier three the part that was difficult for me was learning the tools how to track rates all the tools you know how to staff people all the tools that i'm going to need to now run as a pa learning them was a little bit difficult for me and the first day when they started showing it maybe because they just threw it all on me in one day i was like yo i'm not going to be able to do this um this looks difficult but whenever i had a question i would be sure to ask and ask and ask they took the time they taught me and tommy and taught me until the more that i did it the more became second nature but that was a barrier learning all the new tools all right so this next con is a con it's a con artist it is a contrary it is stress now listen you will have more stress in this position especially more so in the beginning of you learning the position then your latter time in this position but especially depending on the department you're in i've been a pa in inbound been in pa and outbound outbound pa was the most stressful stressfulness that i felt as a human as a being as a human on planet earth stress became a person it would come to me and hug me as a pa in outbound but that was more so when i was just learning it once i got it hands down it was still tough at some times but it still got it done but stress can be on another level as a process assistant that is true i'm not co-li there were some times where everything was just breaking down jam here jam there this person's not making rape why are they crying you just want to go around the corner real quick and be like so stress is a con also another con if you do not like doing overtime you will be doing overtime in this position you'll be coming in earlier for sync leaving later to make sure your department's clean and is ready to pass off to the next team to set them up for success with a good handoff but if you're really on a strict schedule where you have to be out of your job at a certain time you are expected sometimes to stay late all right so another con more responsibility yes it is more responsibility if you do not like responsibility this is not the position for you and the way amazon works if they give you a little pay i mean like little crumbs you know like here you go you would like some more pay and at the same time they have this hand full of responsibility like here you go you're like a newborn rabbit going to the hands as you go there's a hand full of responsibilities that you don't see you don't see this hand up here you see the little the little carrots the little crumb carrots on the hand of morphe then they slam all that responsibility on you no i'm just playing but you will have more responsibility overall if you do not like responsibility this probably won't be the position for you but i've seen it to where people they didn't like responsibility but they just mastered the tools and they were more chill in this position than they were in a tier one so if you just want to work and man i just want to relax and this internet you can do that as a tier three you can master the tools and you will honestly have more chill time as a pa than you would as a tier one i've seen people do that chill all day i mean big chilling was like okay okay jeff mr jeff bezos over here like but the thing is they're just so good with the tools as a pa you're just moving the pieces and one of the main things that i did as a pa you want to have as many hands and arms as possible what do you what i mean by that i would have an ambassador's arm i would have this um problem solver as an arm i would have this ambassador as an arm so when anything goes wrong and i need to be over here i'm utilizing them hey go handle that for me go handle that for me and you go handle that for me i have five things being taken care of as i'm dealing with one situation right here so there were times where i was able to have more time to just sit one place and do what i had to do wow
many things were getting done the process assistant position you can have more downtime there if you're smart about it so if you want to move up in the company definitely want to shoot for the pa position this is honestly one of my favorite positions i had so much fun being a pa um in inbound and outbound most of my dopest memories at amazon was being a pa i mean if you got a dope manager that's the cherry on top right there you and your manager are going to have so much fun in this position definitely a dope position and even when it comes to the finances because when that's what it really comes down to right when it comes to your job you want to make sure you're having fun you enjoy it but you also want to make sure that you are getting compensated for it when you hit the longevity those raises start kicking in you will see that pay i'm reflecting your life especially if you're doing overtime i think it's worth it i would definitely go for it if i was you but anyways this is your boy sb be sure to like be sure to subscribe and be sure to turn on your post notifications so you can see whenever i drop a video catch you guys on the next one let's go [Music] i'm gonna go get it i'm gonna go so i gotta get it i gotta go get it [Music] so i gotta go get it

From_Day_1_To_Year_6_Working_At_Amazon,"What's going on? It's your boy S V. All right, I know it feels like it's been a minute because it has. But I had to do this vlog today. This is a special vlog. I have just hit my 6 years anniversary with the company. You feel me? 6 years and 4 days to be exact. That is a crazy milestone. Especially I say this all the time. I mean, one year is like five years with other companies when you talking about Amazon years, but 6 years lowkey, I think this is the longest. I got to do a vlog on that. I got to check. I'm not 100% sure. But if this isn't the longest I've been with a company, it's probably like second place at this point, but it's likely that this might be the longest I've been with the company, which is 6 years. Shout out to Uncle Jeff. Shout out to my Amazonians out there. 6 years we up in here. That is a long time. When I look back, it went by way faster than what 6 years is. 6 years is a long time. Does it feel like it's been 6 years? Absolutely not. It feels like it's only been like 3 years, but time be flying when you work at Amazon. That's actually one of the things you got to watch out for. You can be so tuned in and so plugged in, time just flies by in the real world. But anyway, 6 years, 3 days. And shout out to everybody who's been rocking with me on the channel for what, the last three years I think I've been on YouTube and kind of documenting my journey. I think it's been like 3 years, but everybody who's been um supporting, you feel me? Dropping encouragement, sharing videos and all that good stuff. Salute to y'all, man. Thank you for the support. 6 years. So, whenever I do these yearly videos, I kind of like to go over certain things, growth, lessons, challenges, advice, all that good stuff. And then I love to start it off with how it started. So how I even started working at Amazon. Was this my dream? You know, kids, oh, I want to be a firefighter. I want to be a police officer. I want to be an astronaut. I want to be a PA. I want to be a process assistant in Amazon. No, sadly that wasn't the case. U but now the way I ended up coming to Amazon was actually through a family member. They were, you know, they were in management and they was like, ""Listen, um, you would kill it over here."" You know what I mean? It was like, ""Yo, you should come over here. The way that you are, just your personality in general, being very, you know, outgoing, um, communicating, already very engaging with people."" He was like, ""Yo, you bring that over here, you will kill it."" So, it was actually a referral from a family member. But I remember at first it took like probably like a year and a half, almost two years for me to fully go. Um, because my perception of the company, I only knew what the internet showed and the internet was talking about. They had to they had to pee in bottles, you feel me? That's all I remember. And that's the only thing I had to go off of. So, when he would tell me that, I'm like, man, I ain't messing with no Amazon. You crazy. But it was when I I used to do arm patrol at that time. A small business owner, you know what I mean? The owner of the company lived right down the street from my dad's house. And it got to the point to where I was like, you know what, I don't feel I'm fully appreciated here. I know I was. I wasn't fully appreciated to what I was bringing to the table. But instead of me just catching a fit and quitting the job, you know, that's when um I was talking to a friend on the phone and his um family member was just about to put an application in. And I said, ""Huh, I think I'm going to do that, too."" And he was like, ""What? You going, you know, you going to go to Amazon?"" I said, ""You know what? I think I am."" And that's how I ended up joining the company. So, it was through a referral from a close family member. And low key, that was a great move. um just due to the fact of how big the company was. When you're dealing with such a big company, growth can happen way faster than it can happen working in a smaller company. So that was one of the first things that I experienced was just that quickness and growth. And I came in at the bottom. I don't think you can come in any lower than what I came in at. I came in as I didn't come in full-time. Um I came in as a seasonal seasonal even I wasn't even a full-time employee. Came in seasonal. Then after that, boom, inbound sto. That's
why I always got to, you know, salute inbound sto. My heart's always there. Um, started off with Inbound Stow. Then became what is it? Um, Pallet Jack Pallet Runner, VRC train, was doing VRC, was doing water spider, then went from water spider to ambassador, PG, so on and so forth. Got to that PA position, um, then to my current position on the corporate side. And it's funny because it's like my perception versus reality. My perception of the company 
before I came was like, yo, I don't know. You feel me? All I know is these viral videos talking about this is the worst place to work. Boom, boom, boom. But that that perception versus reality. Reality for me in my experience was totally different. I seen it as a land of opportunity. I remember I remember my first time walking through them doors. It looked like Disneyland there. ginormous building. Shout out to LGB3. That was my first building where I started off at. It's like a million square feet or something like that. Total crazy big lights, cameras, action, you feel me? Humans everywhere. I was like, yo, you feel me? This seems like the land of opportunity. So the reality then actually working there and moving up and man my experience I'm not represented with a company not a spokesman not a none of that but my reality experience versus the perception was way different um you know even to this day I'm not even in a position that I truly enjoy right now but I appreciate it and still um I think it was a great choice and the reality that I experienced was nothing like what was online when what it was talked about. Um, that's even a vlog I'm going to do. I think Amazon when it I've worked at warehouses before and out of all the warehouses I worked at, Amazon has been the best one. Challenging, yes. Stressful at times, it definitely can be. You feel me? Strenuous, it can be, but compared to other warehouses, you feel me? Cleanliness, safety, all those things, I can't even front. reality was way different than what was perceived and it was, you know what I mean? It was official. So with these six long years, quick long years, my my progression and career growth, I started off as a tier one seasonal, which is entry level. So I went from that tier one to where I am currently at now, which is a level four. So I went from the tier one. Um, all those positions I named earlier were all in the same tier which is still tier one entry level no pay raise. That's the I went I was a stower from the stower to the water spider pallet runner VRC operator even to the PG and ambassador. There's no tier difference in those different all those roles are all the same tier entry level meaning as well the same pay. I definitely think ambassadors should be, you feel me? It should be I think my opinion. I think it'll be dope if there was an incentive there. 50 cents if you an ambassador increase at least 50 cents. I think that'll be dope. Is that what they do? No. But all those are the same tier. So I was a tier one until I hit my first promotion which was the PA process assistant which is that tier three. And um from there um I put in res my resume to go in to a area manager. Then um even before that what was it? It was a learning coordinator which was a L4 hourly and then the corporate role. The corporate role I I only submitted my resume because it was a L4 and it was open. That's not where I wanted to go. It was the AM L4 and learning coordinator. if the L4 area manager didn't go through. So I ended up going to um the L4 on the corporate role. So that's like my career progression within these six years. Um the goal my initial goal for my career progression was to get to that tier one to the L6 which is the operations manager. But it was right around year two where I was like, ah, you know what I mean? Had some turbulence and it caused me to just kind of go to the corporate side and you know what I mean? And to stay there tier four, you know, still good because, you know, I mean, it's still promotion promotion to the corporate side. Um, but it that's what kind of stopped my desire to progress even more from my initial goal was at that 2-year mark. And to me, I'm still super proud of that because even though I stay I'm still a um a tier four level four, every year we have an evaluation. So where we get our we get a base pay raise if you at least meet the bar or go um exceed the bar. And then on top of your base
pay, you also get RSUs. So each year I've been in corporate, have I have had a raise and I've gotten more stock. Um, so that's the good thing about it as well. So with all them different positions, different tiers, I've got to be in different departments and six years with the company still, hands down, my favorite department has to be inbound. That's a fact. I've been an inbound, been an outbound, worked with the doc, um been on the corporate side, um did cold prickleys on the co corporate side. That's like military um per uh military packages and all that stuff. And my favorite department still has to be inbound. Favorite position still inbound PA. Um that's hands down that was my favorite time that I had. I can't lie though, outbound PA. when we were um I was the PA for AF Pack. Super dope as well. But the thing that made that dope wasn't really the the department and the the process. It was the team that was like the best team that I've had with this company. We just flowed. And when you have a great team, that makes all the difference in the workplace. Um so I got to experience that on the outbound um AF side. But just the process and the function, my favorite still is inbound. Inbound sto I would go back tomorrow you facts not to stow but I would go back to inbound PA to if we can negotiate the pay we can negotiate that I would go back tomorrow out of the six years that I've been with the company that's still my favorite department. So with these six years, how have I grown professionally? Is has there been growth? Absolutely. I'm going to tell you this. Listen, I haven't grown at the rate that I have with this company with any other company that I've worked with. And that's one of the things that Amazon does. It's a it could be a pro or a con, but they'll throw you in the water and give you they won't give you a boat. Well, they give you like a you feel me? They'll give you some floaties and then to give you the tools to make a boat. Like here's all the tools. Here you go. You feel me? What are you going to do with it? You going to make a boat? You going to make a canoe? You going to make a raft? You going to make a You know what I mean? And at first I thought it was crazy. I I first learned this as an ambassador. I was I was like, ""All right, cool. I'm an ambassador now. Give me the give what's can I see the the the manual book for being an ambassador? Do I get one of those?"" They said, ""Oh, no. Here's your laptop. Um, we need you to do some coachings."" All right, Ben. What do I do? I don't know. whatever you think it needs to be done. What? So, I literally like had to blueprint myself. But what did that do? It caused innovation. I was innovating things and it was like, ""Hey, um, our whole floor tack time has dropped 10% since you've been out here, you know, the first week and then, you know, 20%. What is you doing?"" So, it causes you numbi. I can't lie. the growth in ownership of owning something. Here we want you to do this and I make the rules and I just go take ownership of that growth. Tremendous growth in that. And here's another level and another area of growth that it helped me. This is not just in the workplace too, but it helped me in the workplace and it also helped me outside the workplace. Leadership facts, you feel me? Because when you get into that ambassador role, when you get into that PG role, when you get into that PA role, you are leading and it's, you know, depending on your team and how you work, but just leadership in general, the growth in that area that I've had in these six years is just job-wise compared to any other job, there is no comparison. You know feel me? every area. I ain't going to lie, from skills, leadership, um having to everything changes with this company, at least from my experience. You feel me? There's new to-do list. Oh, this is being rolled out. This is being rolled out. So, that says talent in itself being able to do this for this month, then all of a sudden do it a whole another way. You know, you you're always changing with the company. That's a skill to be able to do that. It can cause some some stress, you feel me? But it's a skill. So just overall growth in general has been crazy within these six years. And here's what I encourage people. If you're with this company or any company, you want to get these skills and because this is what I see. I see
opportunity in this area with a lot of people who kill it in the company. They have all these skills on the clock and then they clock out and sleep or just watch movies for the rest of their life and just work. Man, utilize the skills that you get in the workplace. Leadership, you feel me? Ownership, engagement, creativity, innovation. Use those things in your life. You know what I mean? I've done that with the things and talents that I've learned and all that. Applying it in my life to expand my life as well. So, within these six years, man, some of the highlights, some of my awards, some of my milestones, um, at least some of the ones I can remember, I had so I ain't gonna lie, I've had so many in each area. I even remember back when being a stoer, I used to get what those things, doc positive, document positive documents, document positive, doc positive, whatever it's called, doc positives where it goes on your record for being like, you know what I mean, being like one of the top performers or something like that. from getting those to um I think though it really came into play once I started to get free reign on creativity and ambassador PG and PA some of those things that I created in those roles did major damage in a great way as an ambassador I took that role and not I took that role I seen I was like this is a very important role but I seen I seen gold there I said Wait a second. I can change the mindset of this department because the first thing the first encounter people have here is with me. That's how I was thinking. I said, ""Yo, I'm going to change this department by changing who comes in here by changing their minds."" I was, that's how I was thinking. So, imagine all the new people coming in is getting this type of content and engagement like my channel on this new place they're working. Bro, every new team that came in by the time they was done, bro, they was ready to change the world and they was doing it. And I had so many people that went on to be managers, went on to be leaders. Literally, the whole department like I don't mean but it was what it was, you feel me? Like it was just it was some next level stuff. So that was super dope. And it was dope too because the leadership seen that. And then the next thing I would probably say which was a dope accomplishment that I remember there's a lot of them but the ones that really that I remember um was when I was a PA in outbound that's when I was creating a project or I had a project that already had an inbound and it was to get you know productivity to help increase productivity was working every time I told my leadership like hey I'm going to run the project and on inbound you basically as a PA we had four PAs and this was on the Stow side and we would have one PA. Each PA will run two floors. North side, south side, you feel me? One and two north, one and two south, one and two um three and four north, three and four south. Each PA had two floors. I loved it because it showed the difference. Everybody had different numbers. Everybody had their own floors so you can see if somebody does something different. So every time I rolled that project out, major difference. I'm talking 40 50% difference in productivity. They was like, ""Yo, not they well they you mean they, you know, LPA is like, ""Yo, what's going on?"" But my ops was like, ""Hey, what's this project?"" You know what I mean? But right at that time is when I ended up going on an away team. Had some family um situations which caused me to move to um my building that I transferred to in Arizona, which was Gyr1. And there is when I fully rolled out the project and that was one of my you know I think one of the dopest success that I had because it caused I don't even know how high it went up but to the point the senior was coming down was like hey we need everything on this project um every link everything that's being done because we just broke every record you know what I mean? So that was super dope and definitely one of the highlights of the career. You know what I mean? But that comes from just that freedom of being able to innovate and hey, if you see something that could be done, run with it. You know, like here's the thing. I've never been denied trying to innovate something. Like no, no, no, no. We can't try that. It's like honestly they low-key get happy. Oh, you can help
productivity. What you got? Well, here warning. Make sure if anything though, just make sure if you do do something cuz that that is how you move up. You feel me? You're doing projects, you're innovating, you're making, you're moving something, you're shaking something. Words of wisdom. But if you going to roll something out, do it loud. You feel me? To where they know this is your project. Because the things with projects, especially successful ones, everybody's going to eat off of it on your team as it's as it's as it should be. But you want to make sure your stuff ain't getting jacked as it shouldn't be. Mine got jacked. You feel me? But through that whole even in that situation that low key was a great growth process that I had to go through even in that challenging moment. So those were some of the highlights that I had within these six years. But in those highlights came some of my greatest challenges in this company. That right there was my greatest challenge when my project got stolen and I didn't get no credit from it. You feel me? Like no straight stolen. That was my greatest challenge in this company. But guess what? I didn't let it make me bitter. It made me better. And to go through something like that and to grow through it that in myself, I didn't know how I was going to get through that. You feel me? But I grew through it. And even in that greatest challenge at this company caused growth. So yeah, there's great things and you're going to have great wins with any company that you with. But there's always, you know what I mean? You're going to have your challenges. You're going to have, you might have some losses as well. Another one of them challenges, you feel me? Is pressure. There's times where that pressure it hit. You feel me? It hit. It was heavy. But even with that challenge, it caused me to grow. with the current role that I'm in. I don't like it. You feel me? I don't like it's bearable now, but look at my vlogs like a year ago, it was at that almost hit that point to where I said, you know, well, I was getting ready to throw in a towel like, ""All right, I might have to leave this company cuz this is not it."" But I stuck in there, you feel me? And it was that was that was another great challenge that I had in these six years. Very uncomfortable. I've never even experienced anxiety until I got into that position. But even through that, still kept going. Still kept going. I hang I was hanging on, hanging on, hanging on. And then that what did that do? And that great challenge caused greater growth. You know what I mean? So it's so dope. Even in the challenges, you feel me? It caused and helped my growth, not just as an employee, but as a person. So those are some of the highlights, some of the lows within these six years, you feel me, of this company. And um and and with that I would I would ask somebody what keeps somebody at a job that long? What keeps you going? What motivates you to stay somewhere for 6 years? That's a long time. And one of the main things was financial. You feel me? Like ah I should have pulled that up. I forgot on your A Toz. No not a Toz there's some app or not app there's some website that's an Amazon website. It shows you percentage-wise um how much your pay has increased since you started. I should have got that. That would have been fire. I totally forgot about that. Dang. Snaps. But that is definitely one of the reasons why I have still stuck it out with the company financially. You feel me? Um in the warehouse, which I was at previously, you can cap out in certain positions. your tier one, there's a cap that you can hit. I think it's after three years. I don't remember. Drop it in the comment section if y'all remember. Well, of course you remember. If you know, drop it in the comment section. Tier three, your cap, your pay starts off higher. Your cap is a little bit higher. On this L4, on the um corporate side, ain't no cap. You know what I mean? So, every year that I stay, I can get a raise. And not just get a raise, I can get stock. So, that's one of those reasons um is due to the pay. And then not just to pay, I am hourly. So this comes in handy all the time. I literally make an investment with my time to work overtime and I'm getting a return on that investment the very next week. And this is one of those companies where in my department at least, you
feel me? Overtime is abundant. It's abundant. And I'm doing so many projects outside of work. They all cost money. All of them need financing. So, that's one of the reasons why I'm still here because I'm investing so much on my on my overtime. I'm getting a return on it the next week. Boom. Putting it into this project over here. Putting into this project over here. And I think that's one of the dopest things. And and then the second thing um is due to the economy. Amazon low-key made it through the last storm of the shutdown. Stormy times, stormy waters. Amazon made it through. in this new situation that we're in in this economy, a lot of layoffs happening, a lot of businesses closing. Um, and I just think that I mean, I could be wrong, but you know, so far in this storm, it's a ship that I feel comfortable in at the moment. You know what I mean? I've said on our lives that we do every Thursday. Check it out if y'all don't be watching it. I think, you feel me, we should always be on the lookout seeing what else is out there just to just in case. But I think um Amazon for the moment is a sha is a safe ship to be on in this storm that's going to get worse. Um that's one of those reasons that I stayed so so long as well. And there was a whole lot more I was going to get into in this video, but we already too long. Um but one of the things I will kind of touch on I thought was a good little topic. But is Amazon a good company to pursue a long-term career? You know, as a long-term career that I think that needs a vlog in itself, honestly. Drop it in the comments section if you think I should just do a vlog on that on itself. But I'll touch it a little bit since I've been here six years. That's not crazy long. There's a gang of people that's been with the company 10 years, 15 years. You know what I mean? There's been people with some years under their belt. But here's the thing. You feel me? shared a thing. In my experience, I'm not a representative of the company, not a spokesman, but I'm going to be honest. I think one of the things that people are going to have to look out for and be aware of if they are coming to Amazon as a long-term career is that stress meter, is that anxiety meter. And the reason why is especially stress. I don't know what it does, but it does it. I mean, I don't know what it does to your mind and your body, but it does it. Stress is not healthy. I don't know what it does. I'm sure if I looked it up, I can find it out, but I don't need to look it up cuz I felt it myself. You feel me? It's a real thing. Stress, you know what I mean? Especially as a long-term like me myself, my personal experience in my opinion, I would not want to be with this company long term and I think this is a dope I think this is a good company. You know what I mean? I you know I don't have I'm very grateful for the company. You know it's a big network. I was able to shift states because they have an Amazon in every single state. The benefits with the company is through the roof. But you feel me? That still doesn't change the fact of stress. But here's the question. Put in the comment section. What job ain't stressful though? There. Okay, I'll take that. There's jobs that ain't stressful. But if if you're planning for a long-term career moving up, nah, I don't think I don't think all companies is the same. But y'all drop your comments on that. What's your opinion on this company long term? Actually, I don't know if we should do that. I think here's the thing. Here's the thing. Here it is. I think if you plan on pursuing, you know, this company long term. Draw your boundaries, which I don't even think you can do. You know what I mean? But to the best of your ability, try to draw boundaries on areas that you, you know what I mean? You can't compromise. like you know family and friends if your f you have a real important friend circle you have a real important family circle because what I do see happen is the job and this is this in every job the job literally takes over a person's life you know what I mean so I just think that has to be guarded and you know what I mean we have to be aware of that because that can easily happen working at any company you get so caught up with the job you tend to forget about life you know but Drop it in the comment section. How long have you been in show job? If you in Amazon, drop it. Let me see how long you've been with the
company. Even if you with another company, how long is too long to stay with a company in your opinion? You know, and I don't think there's a black or white answer for that because everybody's situation is different. But I definitely want to get some of y'all insight in the comment section. Might have to do a follow-up video to it. But this is six years for me. Six long years. Fast but long. I made it. You know what I mean? How long am I gonna go? I don't know. Just four more years would be 10 years with a company. That's deep. That's deep. I don't know. I mean, I don't know. If I did, I would have to be back in the FC. I cannot see myself. And I see things, you feel me? I I see I'm a visionary. I don't see that though. You feel me? Four more years. uh you feel me? Like I don't think that's healthy. But I'll leave it there.

Investigating_Why_So_Many_Amazon_Workers_Are_Dying,"Since 2018, countless Amazon workers have been killed on the job. Countless not just because the death toll is so high, but because there is evidence to suggest that many incidents have been covered up and withheld from the public eye. 2018 was also the same year Amazon brought one-day shipping to more than 10,000 cities. 
And since then, Amazon has been put on the Dirty Dozen list as one of the most dangerous employers in the entire United States. The company has repeatedly ignored safety standards and has used questionable policies to create a dystopian workplace that controls its employees through panic and anxiety, often forcing them to work through injuries, extreme heat, and even a tornado. All so that customers can get their air fryers in one day. 
But what makes working at Amazon so deadly? Well, let's examine the deaths that have been reported and see what's going on. Like in 2013, when Ronald Smith was fulfilling Amazon packages in a distribution warehouse in New Jersey and a conveyor belt jammed. According to a lawsuit from the family, Amazon demanded Herculean production. 
So to avoid a slowdown and get the conveyor going again, Ronald tried to clear it. But his arm got caught and what exactly happened next is a bit unclear. But the complaint from his family states that first he was pulled through a gap less than 6 inches wide. 
Then he fell 15 to 18 feet, hitting the concrete with his head. He was pronounced dead at the hospital due to multiple blunt force impact injuries. Then there's a worker who died at the end of November 2021. 
He approached HR and said, I'm not feeling so well, can I please go home? But he was denied because he had no time off that he could take. This is referred to as unpaid time off or UTO, which builds up the more you work. It's what employees must use if they want to go home early, take a day off for any reason, or if they're late for their shift. 
But if they arrive just 5 minutes after their start time, it's recorded as an entire hour of UTO lost as it's measured by the hour. And so this worker who was feeling too unwell to work, he had no UTO left that he could take. So it was either go back to work or be fired. 
Unfortunately, he was later found dead from a heart attack in a delivery truck trailer. To add insult to death, those who were upset by witnessing the death of their friend were told to go back to work rather than being allowed to go home or take even a moment's break to mourn. A common theme, as you'll see. 
Then there's the 61-year-old man who on December 27, 2022, collapsed from a heart attack on an Amazon warehouse floor. According to witnesses, cardboard bins were used to cordon off
the area so people wouldn't be able to see the dead body, and the warehouse went on business as usual, like nothing had happened. And it seems as though this isn't an isolated occurrence. 
It's a disturbing trend. In March of 2019, a 60-year-old picker, Joe Bowman, went into cardiac arrest. On the 911 call, a manager could be heard telling another worker to get back to work. 
Redditors claim this is a regular occurrence. On the Amazon Fulfilment Centre subreddit, a death was posted and people chimed in with their own experiences. Someone died at my fulfilment centre and work didn't stop, they just moved people from the area. 
Someone died at mine and they just put a slippery floor sign next to the body. Yep, that's what they did at my location too. And further in those comments, one employee talked about yet another death at their centre. 
From what I gathered, it was a member of the maintenance team and he was found in the bathroom on the third floor. I can't fathom how management just sent everybody back to work without so much as making a statement or addressing what was going on. But the problem isn't just how Amazon responds to deaths on the job. 
It's the company policies that may be causing these deaths in the first place. In the same warehouse of that previous 911 call, another death occurred a few months later in September of 2019, when 48-year-old Billy Foister checked into the warehouse's medical clinic, Amcare. These facilities are staffed by on-site medical representatives, or OMRs, who are supposed to be trained EMTs. 
Billy came to them complaining of headaches and chest pains. Chest pains are never something that should be ignored, by the way, and you should seek medical help right away. Amcare checked his blood pressure, said he was dehydrated, gave him beverages to drink, and sent him back to work. 
Unfortunately, a week later while on the job, he suffered a heart attack, and it took a whole 20 minutes until someone found him. They tried to administer CPR, but by the time he got to the hospital, he was pronounced dead. And this is unfortunately all too common. 
Medical concerns being brought to Amcare don't always end with death, but the seriousness of the problems are often ignored. It's why a lot of people complain about Amcare. Like on Reddit, the main complaint seems to be that Amcare is quick to give employees a clean bill of health even if their injury or symptoms are severe. 
Like one employee who allegedly received a foot injury while on the job. They iced it and told me it was a sprain and sent me back to work. I was in so much pain, but they literally were like, sprains hurt, you'll be fine. 
So I went back upstairs and finished my 12 hour shift. I even asked them if I could go home because it hurt too bad. And they said I could, but that I'd have to use my own UPT slash PTO.
They stayed home the next two days because of the pain, and struggled to get any workers' compensation. In the end, after finally seeing a doctor, they were told they had broken their foot. They really don't care about us at all, they explained. 
Of course, that's Reddit, so it's hard to validate. But OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, has investigated Amcare several times, and their findings only reinforce this worrying trend. At one warehouse, they issued a warning stating that Amazon's Amcare returned injured workers to their regular jobs, which resulted in health outcomes such as worsening of the injury, exacerbation of pain, and limited recovery from work-related injuries slash illnesses. 
Then there's also Bobby Gosfinner, an Amazon warehouse employee who spoke with CNBC for an expose on Amazon's injury rates. He described how one day the conveyor belt broke, and led to a pileup of boxes that looked like a tornado had gone through the warehouse. That took more than four hours to clear. 
Because of the twisting and bending at the rapid pace that was expected of him, he got a pain in his back. When he told his manager, the manager tried to downplay it, saying it would take a lot of paperwork. His manager asked if he could take an Advil, put ice on it, and get back to work, which he did. 
But by the end of the day, he couldn't move his right arm, and he woke up with excruciating pain the next day. Turns out, Bobby had a herniated disc. He had to wear a brace and have a surgery to get a plate and four screws surgically inserted into his neck. 
He was awarded permanent partial disability, where he got money and benefits through workers' compensation. But injuries seem all too common at Amazon fulfilment centres, which reveal a deeper problem within the company's exploitative management tactics. In 2021, the Strategic Organising Centre, a coalition of labour unions, released a report about Amazon's epidemic of workplace injuries. 
They found that compared to Walmart warehouses, a company equal to them in size and scope, Amazon had more than twice the amount of injuries each year between 2017 and 2020. And not much has changed since 2020. Senator Bernie Sanders launched an investigation in 2023 and found that Amazon's injuries were 30% more than the industry average. 
And in the Strategic Organising Centre's report from 2024, when they conducted a survey of Amazon workers, 37% of them claimed management pressured them to work before they felt ready to do so. In fact, when compared to injured workers at other warehouses, injured Amazon workers take 52% less time off to heal. But there's a deeper problem with Amcare and Amazon policies as a whole. 
It's actually stated right on internal documents that employees are not allowed to call 911. And as you can imagine, this policy has deadly consequences. On January 18th, 2013, Jeff Lockhart
Jr. was a temporary worker for the Chester, Virginia Amazon Fulfilment Centre, who had collapsed during his night shift. 
While other temporary workers were let go after the holiday peak season in January, he was kept on, giving him hope for permanency, something he wanted. Amazon's internal report marked him as a consistently high performer. He was known for moving quickly up and down the aisles of the 18 football field-sized warehouses to pick all the items as fast as he could. 
Because of his speed and his size, at 6'3 and 300 pounds, he earned the nickname Tornado. Before he got the job in November, he had been jobless for a few months and desperately needed a way to support his family of three children. Two of these children were his wife's from a previous relationship. 
Yet he adopted them and treated them the same as the one child they shared together. Because of the long hours he had been putting in, he and his family were going to meet after a shift for breakfast at Shoney's, a classic American restaurant. Unfortunately, he would never make it to that breakfast date. 
At around 2.30am, he was found unconscious by an employee on the third floor in aisle A215, under shelves of heating pads and Tupperware. The employee didn't call 911. This is the procedure according to Amazon brochures. 
They state, in the event of a medical emergency, contact security with DO NOT CALL 911, all in red, underlined, and with an exclamation point. It goes on to state that security and or Amcare will provide emergency response, which goes against standard CPR protocol. One of the first steps before starting CPR is to call 911. 
Dr. Mikhail Varshavsky, better known as Dr. Mike on YouTube states, you're not actually saving someone's life by doing CPR, you're buying them time. So delaying the ambulance by even a second is extremely dangerous. But when Amcare is faced with an emergency, they may not be able to handle it. 
Many of them are EMTs, however, unlike the brochure might imply, they're limited in what they can do, as their hands are tied. As one Amcare worker explained in the Amazon FC subreddit, by law, because we lack a medical director, we are not allowed to operate at our licence level, EMT or higher, and are instead restricted to first aid only. Another Amcare worker explained 
that, one of the tricky parts is us not having great diagnostic tools. 
Even our blood pressure cuffs are the cheap automatic ones, and I'm not even sure if the pressure dial is accurate. I don't even have access to bag valve masks or Narcan. A UK Amazon employee named Mary spoke to the Tribune about how the real reason for all this is that it may be part of a cover up. 
She says that they're discouraged to call 999, the equivalent of 911 in the United States, explaining, they don't really want ambulances to come on site, sometimes they will offer to pay
for the taxi. They started doing it after there was something in the papers about Amazon calling too many ambulances at their site, likely referring to when The Guardian reported in 2018 that during the span of three years, UK Amazon warehouses called 600 ambulances. Mary also explained how a colleague of hers had signs of a stroke. 
She called her doctor, who said she would need to go to the hospital. The colleague told Amcare, and they said they wouldn't call an ambulance, and she would have to go on her own, all to keep their ambulance numbers down. So when our temporary worker, Jeff, was found unconscious at 2.30am, it took a whole nine minutes for them to finally decide to call 911. 
It took paramedics a total of 20 minutes from the moment that Jeff collapsed for them to reach him. Even though Amcare provided CPR and used the defibrillator, unfortunately, Jeff didn't make it and passed away from an irregular heartbeat, according to the medical record. Meanwhile, his wife and children had been left with grief and no means to support themselves financially. 
Jeff's father went to Amazon and asked the managers what the company would do for their son's family, and their response was, we'll see what we can do. But it seems as though nothing was ever done for them, except for some cash his fellow employees were able to gather together for the family. And it's not the only death potentially caused by the 911 policy. 
In 2018, 61-year-old Mike Golask worked at a Murfreesboro, Tennessee, fulfilment centre. First, when he was found, security was informed as per the policy, but they struggled to find a communication device, as cell phones weren't allowed. One security guard finally called 911, but then, for some reason, put 911 on hold to never return. 
Then afterward, someone else called. According to ambulance records, it took five minutes for them to call 911. Unfortunately, he died of cardiac arrest. 
Now, by this point in our investigation, perhaps you've been noticing a pattern, that many of these deaths are related to heart conditions. Well, that may be because work-related stress is known to exacerbate or even cause cardiovascular diseases and irregular heartbeats. According to the CDC, work is linked to about 10-20% of all cardiovascular disease deaths. 
They attribute it to 10 work-related factors, including long work hours, high performance demand, and low job control. Amazon warns new employees that the job will be physical, but what they don't warn them about is the stress. Due to multiple dystopian management techniques, Amazon has purposely created one of the most stressful workplaces out there. 
To start with, Amazon uses a new style of invasive surveillance in order to optimise their workforce. They've installed a vast camera system in their warehouses, which use AI to track their employees' movements. Each worker is then issued an item scanner. 
From the scanners, they are given a task, such as retrieving an item. When they pick the item, they scan it, and the scanner then records the time between scans. Once a task is done, you're
immediately given a new task, and an anxiety-inducing countdown timer starts ticking down. 
This is all according to an expected rate. You see, management sets a rate for you, which can change day-to-day, even hour-to-hour, without warning. If you're picking boxes from the shelves, it may be as high as 80 boxes per hour. 
That's 45 seconds per box. If the countdown timer hits zero before you're able to scan another box, the scanner gives you a warning that you've taken too much time off task, or TOT, and it will alert management. At one warehouse, an employee said that they only had 18 minutes a shift that they could be off task, and if they racked up too much TOT, they could be fired, a policy which has put many employees in deadly situations. 
Even bathroom breaks count towards your TOT. This means you're at a disadvantage if you need to go to the bathroom often, or if you're far from a bathroom in the massive warehouse. Author James Bloodworth investigated workplaces for his book, Hired, six months undercover in low-wage Britain. 
He worked at an Amazon fulfilment warehouse and discovered on a shelf tucked away was a bottle full of urine. He realised that the fear of getting fired led some workers to urinate in bottles in the name of efficiency. Even if it's an action that isn't directly condoned by Amazon, they've created the environment that leads to this mentality. 
Some will even purposely not intake fluids while on the job to avoid TOT, leading to dehydration. If you hydrate, eventually you've got to use the bathroom, said Stephen Hicks, an employee for Amazon. He explained how he didn't like using the bathroom outside official breaks to not hurt his rate. 
It makes me afraid, mentally and physically exhausted, said Hibek Mohamed, a stower from a Minneapolis Amazon warehouse. Workers have described the environments as Lord of the Flies-esque, where the weakest are picked off one by one. With a few mistakes, you could be terminated suddenly, with about 1 in 10 Amazon workers will get fired within the span of a year. 
If the Amazon automated system determines your productivity is low, it can even let you go without any human input. Amazon worker Danielle Olaiwola explained, You're being exploited because they know you're a hard worker, and then once you break down, they're like, Oh, well, we got a good 6-9 months out of you, you're out of here, and you're literally just used. This creates a constant low-grade panic that puts a physical and mental strain on workers every hour of the day, even during off hours. 
Hibek Mohamed added, I feel, and a lot of workers, they feel, even when they're sleeping, that they're docking to try and hit their rate. Because they're worried about next week, what's going to happen. You don't know what's going to happen. 
I don't know what I finished this week. Next week, if I hit the rate, if the rate will change. And
managers are watching you and coming to you all the time. 
You feel like someone is watching you while you're sleeping. Emily Gwendelsberger, author of On the Clock, What Low-Wage Work Did to Me and How It Drives America Insane, also went undercover at Amazon. She explained, It took my body two weeks to adjust to the agony of walking 15 miles a day and doing hundreds of squats. 
But as the physical stress got more manageable, the mental stress of being held to the productivity standards of a robot became an even bigger problem. You can't slow down if you're tired or hurting. It's why some employees have shared stories about how they've broken down crying at work. 
Speed is the priority, so they can get packages out for one or two day shipping. This leads to stress and mistakes, which leads to injuries and death. And this problem extends out to their drivers as well, who use a navigation software called Dora, or Rabbit. 
It both recommends and monitors routes for drivers, tracking their every turn. The software gives them a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks, and they're told that 999 of 1,000 packages must be delivered on time or face termination. When you're driving a delivery van, barreling down the road, the pressure to perform means there are a lot of mistakes and potential deaths involved. 
Like in August of 2022, a two-year-old girl was playing outside in a parking lot when she was fatally hit by an Amazon driver trying to get their packages out on time. She was declared dead on the scene. It left the family grieving, unable to sleep at night, saying, There are no words to describe the amount of pain. 
They wanted to sue Amazon, but they ran into an issue of liability. While they were an Amazon driver, they didn't technically work for Amazon. That's because as a means to extend Amazon's network and to keep their hands clean, Amazon has turned to outsourcing some of their deliveries to independent companies. 
They provide them with all the technology to monitor their drivers, provide routes, determine how many packages must be delivered in a day, and decide on what vans to use and how the drivers must dress. Then they leave it up to the company on how to maintain their workforce. As you might imagine, with Amazon being the majority or sometimes their sole client, these companies will do anything to keep the contract to deliver these packages, even if it's at the expense of the workers. 
As a result, they take on the deadly Amazon mentality of optimisation at all costs, without even realising it. They've been reported to have forced their workers to skip meals, urinate in bottles, speed to make deliveries, and not wear seatbelts to get out of the truck faster. This resulted in the horrific loss of an innocent life in December 2016, when a driver named Vladimir Grey flew down the Chicago roads, trying to deliver all the packages in time for Christmas.
Amazon Echo speakers were the hot item that year. They even sold out. However, in the rush, Vladimir hit Telesfora Escamilla, an 84-year-old grandmother who was walking at a crosswalk. 
He crushed her diaphragm, ribs, and skull as she lay dying in a pool of blood. He leapt out of the van and screamed, Oh my God! After police arrived, he tested negative for drugs and alcohol, and was later charged with reckless homicide, which he would be acquitted for in 2019. When the family of the deceased sued Amazon, the delivery company, Inpax, and the driver, Amazon claimed no responsibility, as it technically wasn't their driver. 
In response to BuzzFeed and ProPublica reporting on this and other fatalities caused by drivers of Inpax and two other companies, Amazon dropped these companies, further distancing themselves from blame. As a result of losing these contracts, a total of more than 2,000 workers from these companies lost their jobs. One step Amazon took to allegedly make things safer for the delivery drivers was to instal an AI surveillance system in 2021 called Netrodyn. 
It's designed to make the drivers much safer on the road by capturing violations like texting on your phone, staying too close to cars, and not using your turn signal. In theory, this should make things safer for the employees and pedestrians alike. The problem is, it tends to punish drivers for mistakes they didn't make. 
Like how one driver in Los Angeles kept getting violations for not maintaining a safe distance when he was constantly being cut off, or another who was using his phone for directions. And even with the AI surveillance system, Amazon drivers are still causing deaths on the road. In November of 2024, an Amazon driver hit and killed a 79-year-old woman who was crossing the street. 
He fled the scene and allegedly continued delivering packages. It's unclear why he kept delivering packages, but one might assume it was due to the pressures of the job. While narcotics were found in the van, there's no report of him being under the influence at the time. 
In this case, surveillance didn't help make things safer, but perhaps that's not the ultimate goal of surveillance. Like in the warehouses, it may just be another means to track their employees to make sure that speed is always the number one priority. Ultimately, it's not just one thing that contributes to these deaths. 
It's a culmination of policies, poor safety practises, and the stress-inducing environment. So will Amazon ever be held accountable for any of this? Well, not if they have anything to say about it. On September 24th, 2017, 59-year-old Phillip Lee Terry was working a shift at an Amazon warehouse in Indiana. 
He was told to fix a forklift. With a wrench in hand, he passed under the forks with a platform attached to it. That's when the 1,200-pound piece of equipment fell onto him. 
It took two hours before someone found a pool of blood, with him in the centre of it dead. It's unclear why with all that surveillance, he wasn't found until then. But regardless of why it took
so long, OSHA inspector John Stallone arrived the next day. 
He noticed that a pole that was designed to hold up the forklifts, as per safety regulations, wasn't used. Either you need to prop up the forks or, more ideally, never pass underneath them. The hydraulics can give out and the equipment on the forks can fall on you. 
Again, it's hard to speculate why Phillip didn't follow regulations, but to quote one Amazon employee, it's incredibly hard to meet rate while following all safety procedures. But on top of that, it was also discovered that there was no written record of Terry having received any formal training, so he may not have known what the safety procedures in a situation like this were. Inspector Stallone said that safety was second to production demands for Amazon. 
Due to the inadequate training, OSHA fined Amazon $28,000, a small fee for the $2.5 trillion company. Stallone did want to raise the fines, but got pushback. Feeling something was off, he started recording the conversations he had with his boss, rightly so, because eventually his boss asked him to shift the blame from Amazon to the employee and to lift the fine. 
This was in a recording he shared with Reveal, an independent news organisation. His boss wanted to partner with Amazon to help them become a leader in safety. She went on to say that Terry was likely on drugs, even though the coroner said there was nothing but nicotine in Terry's system. 
There was a reason for this, according to Stallone. Amazon was looking for a place to set up their new headquarters, and the city of Indianapolis was a finalist. Stallone had a meeting with the labour commissioner who stated it would be nice to get the headquarters, and asked Stallone to back off from the investigation or resign. 
Shortly after, Stallone's supervisor said he was going to be terminated for job performance issues, and so Stallone ended up resigning. Then he reached out to Reveal and provided the recordings, but sadly, nothing came out of the exposure. And a year later, with Stallone out of the way, Amazon signed a deal with OSHA to waive away all of the fines, and put the blame of this incident entirely on the deceased employee. 
And ready for the real kicker? In the end, Amazon didn't even choose Indianapolis for their headquarters. And it wasn't the only time OSHA was steeped in corruption with Amazon. Like during the blistering summer of 2022, when three workers died within the span of three weeks in Amazon warehouses across New Jersey. 
Temperatures during those three weeks were excessive, ranging from 90 to 97 degrees Fahrenheit. The first death took place on July 13th, the second day of the Amazon Prime Day sales event. During the pandemic, Amazon's 2022 Prime Day event garnered $11.9 billion, an increase of 62.8% from the previous year's revenue of $7.31 billion. 
So one could assume the workers at the Carteret New Jersey Fulfilment Centre probably had their hands full. Rafael Ronaldo Mottafria had been complaining about the heat in his
unconditioned workspace. Coworkers said he was pleading for fans, but he was told to work through it. 
Then he collapsed and passed away. Then on July 24th, at the Robinsville, New Jersey Amazon warehouse, Roger Bolin fell off a ladder and hit his head, dying in hospital three days later. And on August 4th, at a delivery facility in Monroe, a man named Eric Wadinsky was hospitalised and died four days after. 
But not much more can be found about this incident. OSHA investigated the three deaths. They claimed that Rafael had a previous heart condition which led to a heart attack, and Amazon wasn't held responsible again, even though heatstroke is known to cause heart attacks. 
Then when OSHA investigated the second incident of Roger, who fell off a ladder, it's reported that OSHA was denied access to the room where the accident occurred, until a few weeks later once the heat had died down. They determined that he had died of a seizure, but the doctors noted that he had an extremely high body temperature, and he had died of a brain injury due to the fall, so it could be possible that he was affected by the heat wave somehow. But regardless, Amazon wasn't deemed responsible. 
For the third, not much is known because no information was released, but as you might expect, Amazon wasn't held responsible. What's more odd is that OSHA's reports are supposed to be made public after their conclusion, yet only the report for their first death was released, which is why Warehouse Life, an Amazon workers' rights group, filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act to release the other reports on August 14th of 2024. OSHA never responded, which prompted the workers' rights group to file a lawsuit in November. 
As of February 2025, the reports still haven't been released. Amazon went on to state they bear no responsibility for these deaths and wish these tragic incidents wouldn't be twisted into something they weren't. But these deaths most likely could have been avoided if they had better working conditions, with proper air conditioning. 
And this wasn't the only time that Amazon has forced their employees to work through these intense weather conditions at the expense of their lives, all in the name of maximising profits. In fact, just eight months prior, Amazon warehouse workers were told to keep working during the deadliest December tornado outbreak in U.S. history. It was December 10th, 2021, in Edwardsville, Illinois, the day was warm for this time of year. 
The weather was ominous. The last three days were filled with warnings from meteorologists, with forecast models showing severe weather. But with the holidays looming, it was peak season, as Amazon referred to it, with temp workers hired and regular employees working overtime. 
There was even an added incentive for the drivers. If they could deliver 200 packages that day, they would get a $25 gift card. So it wasn't uncommon for the drivers to stuff their vehicles with
several hundred boxes at a time. 
One driver, Deontay Yancey, was out delivering packages, without his coat since it was oddly warm out. But as he dropped off the packages one by one, the customers would look at him surprised. Why are you still working, they would ask. 
All he could do was shrug and say, because Amazon wants me to. Perhaps it had something to do with the tornado warning put out that morning. The warning was set to a moderate risk, which is actually quite high, being level 4 out of 5. Damaging gusts, large hail, and a few long track tornadoes during the evening hours were predicted. 
All the while, Amazon warehouse workers and their drivers, under the watchful eye of their managers and AI surveillance, ready to catch any infraction, were still trudging along, trying to avoid bathroom breaks and meet their rate as time counted down on their displays. At 5.30 p.m., a tornado watch was fully in effect as supercell thunderstorms spread across Missouri, and by 7 p.m., they were making their way to the St. Louis metropolitan area, near the Edwardsville Amazon warehouses. Leslie Campbell, an Amazon worker who was off that day, 
used to chase tornadoes as a teenager, but this storm was unlike anything she had experienced before. 
It became pitch white from the rain, she explained. It had a weird feeling to it. It was around this time when sirens started to blare in nearby areas. 
Texts between an Amazon driver and her supervisor were obtained by Bloomberg News, revealing the frightening situation. At 7.08 p.m., the driver texted her supervisor, stating, Radio's been going off. The supervisor responded with, Okay, just keep driving. 
We can't just call people back for a warning unless Amazon tells us to do so. As the winds picked up, the storm got worse, and warnings were becoming more frequent. At 7.35 p.m., a tornado touched down in St. Charles County, 48 miles from the Amazon facility. 
This was the first one to hit the area, and many more tornadoes would come. In fact, it ended up being one of the deadliest Decembers on record. An EF-4 touched down a bit earlier, at 7.07 p.m., south of the facility in Arkansas. 
For reference, EF-5 is the highest the rating can go. This one in St. Charles was an EF-3. This file is longer than 30 minutes.

Why_I_Quit_Working_At_An_Amazon_Warehouse_Job,"All right, so this video I want to talk about Amazon and what it's like to work at the warehouse in Amazon And the reason why I left Um, and is it for you and what happens on your first day? so I want to cover all that and kind of give you a better sense of Either the decision you're about to make the decision you've made. So this is my personal opinion Um, i'll be honest thousand percent honest Uh, but aside from that I know my previous videos this is this is kind of like a kind of veering off the The waggon a little bit. I know i've been talking a lot about my personal life and what's been going on um, but I want to make a a work-related video And give you guys a better sense Of what it's like to work amazon because i've been seeing a lot of you know, uh, like day Uh day the life of it of a amazon worker Um Warehouse worker really because that's what I did. 
It is about like 11 15 i'm, extremely tired, but You know, I tell myself i'm gonna do 100 videos. I believe this counts as my sixth one so um I'm, just trying to be as disciplined as possible and being uh Very tired as possible. Anyway, so First day at amazon what happens? Um, you're gonna go to orientation What that consists of is um You know, uh what it's like to work amazon basically you're going to get projector, right? They're going to give you a screen to look at. 
I believe it's like an hour or two. Um Maybe more I can't I can't remember All I know is it was a lot To look at you know staring at a screen that that's also considered your training Which I mean you can't really learn from a computer if you're staring at a screen for hours upon hours anyways, so You know with that after that we went to the warehouse I'm gonna be honest guys, right? So I work i'm a blue collar worker. I'm a welder. 
I'm a metal fabricator um You know, so and I also have some hands-on experience Um just using tools, you know like around the house and since i've grown up i've used tools and you know other stuff And I educated myself on a lot of things but this Uh warehouse work It's a whole it's a whole different world and not in a good way, honestly, so again First so first day we get there, you know, we went on orientation Uh training I guess we looked at a seen a video The video is honestly so animated to where it makes it look like what it's not right and I say that because when we went to the warehouse It was like I Immediately thought I was like this thing can work out just because of how everything it was so like robotic and it was so like a machine based operation to where You're essentially you're a machine, right? Yeah. Yeah, it's repetitive work and um, you're standing on your feet and I'll get into that and you know, I'll get into that a little bit. But anyway, so first day we get there and this was overnights That was the only position available the pay was shitty It wasn't good. 
Um I believe they started they started off at like 18 50 an hour and this was 2000 I said like 2023 To about a year and a half ago. Um Yeah, it was It wasn't good But you know, it was full-time hours. Uh benefits were included a lot of fun stuff.
You know, my son was um I think he was you know, he wasn't born at the time She was still pregnant with him. My ex was still pregnant with him And so, you know at the time I was you know going to school for welding and also looking for a part-time job This happened to be one of them. So I I went Um, yeah, so we get to the warehouse. 
They walked us down the warehouse and you know just the The presentation that they presented was it was false. It was just a false image. I was like, oh this is what we do they made it seem like um Like you have to like it. 
I don't know in a way to put it You have to see you have to go ahead and see what I mean but they put it in a way where you have to like it is like, um, No, this is what you're gonna be doing and you know like this It's uh, it's it's easy word, you know And just let us know like if you need a break and they kept emphasising breaks and they kept emphasising like you know, um Oh, 
you know make sure you eat before you work They didn't say the specific reason why they just kept they mentioned they kept mentioning that you know, um During the the walk around they call it And i'm thinking to myself. Why do you keep mentioning breaks? well After they after they walked us around they uh handed us off to The warehouse man one of the warehouse managers And and sent this uh different sections to where so I was in this shipping and receiving basically. It's a huge conveyor belt And once you you know, once you get to your station, they call it And pretty much it's like an aisle right and in the aisle you have different Different little boxes where you where you grab your package and you put them in different boxes That are assigned to those specific locations for the boxes um, think of it like a grocery aisle, right except smaller in your And that's just that's your section, right? You have to stay there Um until unless they move you elsewhere, which they do a lot they're gonna move you, you know around a lot so Well, there's different lingos to to this stuff. 
I don't I mean you it's all pretty much io based um And scanning that's all it is So you either do that you you know, you scan the items and you put it away or you're the person um That's right in front of the conveyor belt taking the items and putting them in uh carts To where the people behind you? Is taking the packages and scanning them and then putting them back in the little aisles right in little bags so Um, I that part that part I hated I hated I mean I hated it all around but that part I hated because for example Right and and follow me here if you're late Right if you're going kind of slow, which is going to happen either way if you're going kind of slow to get a package They're just gonna pile up pile up pile up pile up a lot of people but a lot of people on youtube talk about this, they're gonna they're gonna pile up and Eventually they gotta stop they gotta stop the conveyor belt The conveyor belt is basically the machine that that brings the packages. That's called the conveyor belt. Um Yeah, so then you know, you're gonna they're gonna they gotta stop the conveyor belt And they gotta help you out put your packages away and then they turn the grey boat back on so basically, it's like you you're always trying to find like For example, like letter e or b or a And putting it right behind you, right? so you're finding it you find a put it behind you find it a and it's like It's so it can get overwhelming And again, it's not you're not doing anything else, but that for hours upon hours, so And then on top of that right, um There's hardly no there's really no training on it.
They just tell you oh you can just do this And that's pretty much it when it comes to scanning they train you a little bit, but just enough to where You know you you feel rushed and that's how they get you to kind of move Uh faster, it's all it's all it's all systematic based um It's an it's an operation. That's very sleazy. It's an operation. 
That's very beneficial only for people who are um above the the the you know the management foe um, and again I I don't I wouldn't recommend warehouse drivers to anybody Um, so anyways, yeah, so that's that was that's your first day Now your second day Is like I said, this is a systematic approach that they have. So your second day is basically Trying to be faster than your first day And every day is going to be like that This is why it's overwhelming. This is why they have a lot of turnover, especially in the amazon warehouse um Because it it's overwhelming, right? They overwhelm you with with work and they expect you to do it at a certain time because everything is time-based Trucks come at a certain time These packages gotta get put on the conveyor belt at a certain time These packages gotta get scanned And put away at a certain time. 
So the vans for the For your for your shipment could get to your house. It's all you know, it's all time-based which I get it You know, I think I get it's an operation um, but delays are going to happen and when they do that's when The overwhelming happens, right? So, okay, I kind of veered off a little bit. So yes first day. 
Um, going back to your first day your break time Break was uh 45 minutes Um, and I believe overnight is kind of like the the opening for jobs because You know, there's there's nobody out on the road yet. Um, The the trucks pick up the the packages early morning so they can get delivered You know, they can get out on the road Early early. So this is why overnight is kind of the thing when it comes to warehouse So anyways, yeah break time is uh, you know, it's kind of like the opening of the day Oh, man My first break I took a nap And I got like a 30-minute nap um that day I knew I was like this this ain't gonna have this ain't gonna work out and on top of that, you know, you're you're basically Relying on energy drinks And I don't care how many energy drinks you you you drink when you get tired, you're gonna feel it, right? You're gonna feel it in your body Um, oh, they also give you a booth allowance, which is nice kind of nice, I guess um But make sure you get comfortable boots so Uh, you go, you know coming back from 
break now it I I don't i'm not making this up. 
You have to go back in at a certain time I believe If you're one minute late They deduct a certain amount of time. Um in your pay cheque I believe I ask somebody about that, but that is a thing I think it's like 10 minutes or so if you're a minute if you're a minute late Like 10 minutes something like that. So basically with that right? Everybody's just lined up when it comes to like bathroom breaks um It's almost like a mission that you have to ask like I I've asked my first bathroom break. 
I've asked like two people you know, they're I guess I asked one of the Managers near the conveyor belt because there's you know, different aisles whatever So I asked the manager he's
like oh go ask so and so um because you know, we can't sell the conveyor belt and I thought to myself I was like So what if we all have to use the bathroom, you know what's gonna happen, you know? Anyway, so I went to go ask the other guy and he was he kind of like hesitated a little bit He was like, well, how long do you think you're gonna be gone for? And i'm thinking to myself. Oh gosh, you know I said five ten minutes, you know, I don't know So he was like, okay. Well, um, yeah, just try to be gone for you know, no more than 10 minutes Okay, that was my first day by the way, so fast forward, right? Um, you know, I leave leave clock out whatever I man, I got like no sleep because at the time I said I was going to school and this is you know, This my situation was different from everybody else's but again in a nutshell, that's what you get your first day At amazon warehouse. 
So I go home um and take a nap and I get out I got out at at 12 30 Right and it took me about half hour to get home. So I got home like around one Mind you I had to go to that wasn't welding school at the time. So I had to be in class at five o'clock So I got home, you know, obviously you don't fall right to sleep when you get home You kind of settle down about an hour. 
So I believe I fell asleep around Around two o'clock that gave me about uh, three hours of sleep Now I gotta get up and weld I gotta go to school. Um Yeah, so Second day right second day Actually, no i'ma fast forward So basically my second day was like my first day except I had to go faster or whatever So a week later goes by right? Um This was uh, yeah, this is a week later so I get I get to um I get to work right as soon as I get to work Like I I mean I had the bubble guts. I'm not gonna lie. 
I had a bubble guts And I had to just I had to hold it, right? Because I didn't I didn't want to go to the hassle of going through so-and-so to get to somebody's to use the bathroom But eventually I had to use the bathroom Um, and i'm about two energy drinks down. I at the time I was drinking. Uh I drank a red bull and about like four hours later. 
I drank uh, zoa but You know those things kick in pretty fast. I don't know Energy drinks just flow by me. Sometimes certain energy drinks. 
They just go right back down And they come out. You know what I mean? So eventually I just wait I couldn't find anybody. So I just left. 
Um Luckily, it was kind of slow, but I guess so when I came back it was wrong. I took about 15 minute break, right? And I get back and So the the one of the managers if you guys know if you guys have been to amazon warehouse Or if you guys do work amazon warehouse and considering and considering uh leaving this is this is what I mean So they come in little carts with the computer, right and he's looking down the aisles and he finds me So he turns my way and he goes. Um He goes Hey, you okay? I'm like, yeah, that's it. 
You know, let's go back to the bathroom. He goes you sure i'm like, yeah Then he goes I can't make this up. He goes He goes, uh, it sees it it shows my computer you're gone for uh, he said
like It was like a specific a specific time frame. 
It was like he said Uh, it was like a double digit number with like in a couple seconds i'm like Yeah, I have to use the bathroom then he goes do you need like a doctor's note or anything I thought he was kind of joking. So I kind of laughed it off and He didn't seem like he was joking. He was kind of serious and I was like No, I didn't know And so, you know, I mean it was kind of going back and forth and I yeah I was like, I didn't know I had to I didn't know I was being 
watched, you know While walking to the bathroom Being used, you know, he kind of got like attitude back So I kind of just shrugged it off a little bit. 
Um and again that day man, I was like this this But again, this is the things that you did the things that happen at the warehouse, right? I mean any warehouse job is There's something about a warehouse job where you you get humbled quick, right? And not in a way where you you develop some grit and you're not you know And and you get like this this sense of pride, 
you know, it's a warehouse you're working in a warehouse Um, and basically you you are a number, right? It's not i'm not gonna say you're like a number basically. Well, you are a number Um, and you have to accept that Honestly, it's like it's like the military or you're just a number so um A month later, I mean, I just I couldn't do it anymore. Um, I was getting no sleep um I am 
an insomniac. 
So I've been doing that overnight and then Got to being welding class at five o'clock um You know and you gotta do it all over again. Eventually that catches up with your body and you know, you just you You think different right you just feel different, you know, you feel like you're just Just your body is moving and your brain it's like when you know when you wake up and it brings us down That's that's kind of how it was so If you're thinking about going to work to the amazon warehouse um, I say please Rethink that venture out. There's other jobs out there Um, don't do it just for the money the benefits are I mean it that's kind of an you know, it's it's an incentive um, it seems like it's very like catchy, you know, but I mean There's other jobs out there. 
Amazon is not it if you do Work there and you're considering leaving and you just want more information. This is coming from a person who's worked there Uh leave All right, leave um There's I mean there's room for growth I guess but if you I mean if you like that type of environment, you know, then I guess This video Disregard this video but If you're not and if you want something else and you know, you have them you have this you have the amazon the amazon job And you want something more? that you know There is something more right you can go Uh look for another job um Don't do it just for benefits benefits are everywhere now um, you know Develop some skills or even venture off to a new job that can give you some skills, right? You can't really build a skill base working at a warehouse, you know, i'm not bashing anybody But for people who you know who who want more who want to learn more who want to learn skill you can do that You just can't do it at a warehouse Um I know some warehouses they do have um forklifts I worked at a paper mill. I learned how to drive a forklift there um, so that was pretty cool, I guess but You know when you're when you're somewhere and you feel
like you're just a number then It that's when it's time to go if you Just apply to amazon and you're looking at videos and you want a better idea what your first day is going to be like then just just accept that Um, it's not gonna be what they make it seem right and you will see what I mean Because I thought that right I was I was I was excited when I got the job because it was it was very easy Hi, I didn't get an interview right, basically, I just I applied they told us where to go to take a drug test and then Um, I wanted to go through the drug test Then I waited a little bit they said well your date your first day is going to be uh, I forgot what day a full orientation be there at Uh, I think it was like 1 a.m Yeah, it was like 1 a.m And I was like, okay. 
Yeah, like cool, I guess, you know, I never I never had a job where I didn't have to interview That's how it's like at amazon, right? It's a very quick hire very easy process, but In the back end you will see what's to come. I hope that kind of answers your Your questions that you've had to do you wanted? um and Give you a better idea of how the first day is going to be. I wish I had a better I wish I had like an actual visual um You know like one of those spidey glasses at an amazon job, but Yeah, and also keep in mind um If you don't like being micromanaged this is that's not a job for you if you don't Like being watched every movie make which I understand because there's sensitive packages out there um, there's packages, uh that that You know are expensive. 
There's I mean it's people people who purchase items online. I get it You know, they want to watch everybody and there's history of people stealing stuff But if you're not that person and you don't like being watched That ain't the job for you the food at the vending machines very expensive so pack your own food um If you're a coffee drinker Make sure you load up on your caffeine I know your energy. I know my energy drink people, you know Double up I guess for snacks double up. 
Um, try to think what else that can benefit you um You don't wear jeans wear something comfortable you can do that basically wear whatever you want Except you have to have steel toe boots I recommend composite boots because they're lighter. Um Try to think what else so you get your vest you get the Yeah, that's pretty much it. And then you're you're off to races. 
So You know, oh, yeah again you do get your benefits they do kick in the first day but again I wouldn't stick around for the district benefit because If you don't like the job and you're getting great benefits, you're gonna be miserable You don't and if you have a family again um Do what you have to do don't use this as some long-term gig use this as a stepping stone You don't want to be you don't want to bring the work home with you, right? In other words, you don't want to have a bad day at work and then be miserable when you get home because of work And that'll 
affect the household. You don't want to do that And that's that's very good advice so Um, I don't know. I think it's like 12 o'clock now. 
So it's passing bedtime I'm gonna cut this video. I just want to give you guys the best idea of what it's like to work amazon um, and What it'll be like for your first day and why I left so hopefully that helps out Like the video comment leave your comments if you Again, if you apply
leave your comment if you work there If you work at amazon leave your comment if you worked at amazon leave your comment You could help me get the comment section Um again, that's why I talk about my experience at amazon. I would never work there. 
I hate it. I'm gonna be honest Anyways, i'm saying now it's passing bedtime. I'm going to bed. Peace

Why_So_Many_Amazon_Workers_Are_Getting_Hurt,"For years, Amazon warehouse workers like Daniel Olayiwola have been speaking up about unsafe conditions and the risk of injury they say they face, while churning out millions of packages every day so they can reach prime member doors in two days or less. Now their claims are being backed up by the most recent industry-wide data, showing Amazon warehouses had far higher injury rates than its competitors in 2021, and leaked internal memos that show a high turnover rate to match. You're being exploited because they know 
you're a hard worker. 
And then once you break down, they're like, oh, well, we got a good six to nine months out of you. You're out of here. And you're literally just used. 
In response, federal authorities have stepped in, coordinating inspections across seven Amazon warehouses in five states last summer, finding Amazon is failing to keep workers safe. And at every single facility, we found serious hazards that were putting workers at serious risk of bodily harm. The Department of Labour has taken swift, decisive action against Amazon so far this year, issuing citations at all seven warehouses. 
I want to cry. Workers like Bobby Gosfiener, who needed neck surgery and months in a brace after a conveyor belt malfunctioned at his Amazon warehouse in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It's two years of my life. 
I can't get back. Workers like Lenita Hammonds, who hopes to make it to retirement without further injury to her shoulder. They want me to get my rate up, get my rate up, get my rate up. 
And Jennifer Crane, who remains on the job with a torn ligament in her wrist. I wear a brace to this day still because it hurts. After like two hours of heavy lifting, I'm taking pain meds. 
Now, in a rare case of federal cooperation, the Justice Department is also investigating Amazon. Not because they think the company is cooking their profits numbers, but because they think the company might be making false statements about the worker safety crisis. This is extremely unusual. 
This is the story of some workers who've been hurt, of those who are sticking around to demand better, and what the government and Amazon are doing to answer the call. We've never seen the federal government have such a pointed, intense investigation in such a short period of time at such a large employer all at once. Eric Fruman has been tracking safety in workplaces for nearly 50 years, testifying at multiple congressional hearings, including one about unsafe practises at Amazon in November. 
As of last year, Amazon caused more serious injuries to warehouse workers than all the rest of
America's warehouses combined. He's the health and safety director at the Strategic Organising Centre, a labour union coalition that represents some 3 million workers. Although Amazon approaches the data differently, when the SOC crunched federal 2022 injury data, it found that while Amazon employed 36 percent of all U.S. warehouse workers in 2022, it was responsible for 53 percent of all reported U.S. warehouse injuries. 
One third of the workers, half the injuries, 25,000 serious injuries a year, 100 percent turnover in these warehouses. What price is America willing to pay as a community, as a nation, to get one-day delivery, two-day delivery? The coordinated federal inspections at Amazon began last summer following the release of 2021 Bureau of Labour Statistics data showing Amazon's serious injury rate was 43 percent higher than the warehouse industry average. The Labour Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, found unsafe conditions and ergonomics hazards at seven warehouses in Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Illinois and New 
York. 
OSHA acted on referrals from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which observed workplace hazards in its own investigations of the facilities. Two more warehouses were cited for safety violations on the state level by Washington's Department of Labour. OSHA also cited Amazon for 14 record-keeping violations, finding it failed to properly report worker injuries and illnesses. 
Amazon is appealing all the citations. What is most concerning is the scale. We have every reason to believe that the types of processes where we found hazards in these facilities are processes that are used in Amazon facilities across the country. 
Doug Parker was sworn in as the head of OSHA in 2021. At some of these facilities where we conducted inspections, the rate was high as 12 workers out of every 100. So that's more than 10 percent of the workforce every year who are receiving injuries on the job that are serious enough that they have to take time away from their jobs. 
And this isn't a new trend. Since 2016, employers have been required to submit injury reports to OSHA for any facility with at least 20 employees. Amazon has consistently reported tens of thousands of workers with injuries every year. 
Perhaps not surprising for the country's second biggest private employer with more than 750,000 U.S. warehouse workers. What is surprising is how Amazon's injury rate has remained higher than others in the warehousing and storage category since at least 2019. OSHA calculates injury rates by looking at how many injuries and illnesses occurred for every 200,000 hours worked, the equivalent of 100 employees working full-time for a year. 
The number OSHA and the SOC use to define serious injuries is the DART rate, cases that involve days away from work, job restriction or transfer. The most recent industry-wide DART rates are from 2021. The warehousing industry as an average in 2021 had a DART rate of 4.7 per 100 workers.
In the case of Amazon, that number based just on what they report. So it's almost one and a half times the industry average. While OSHA's 2022 industry totals won't come out until November, Amazon says its DART rate remained largely unchanged at 6.7 per 100 workers. 
When it comes to injuries of all types, Amazon told CNBC its total warehouse injury rate in 2022 went down 9 percent, 6.9 per 100 workers from 7.6 in 2021. That's still higher than industry averages and its closest competitor, Walmart. An SOC analysis of total recordable injuries across Walmart and Amazon from 2017 to 2020 found Amazon's injury rate was between double and triple that of Walmart's every year. 
When it comes to warehouses as a whole, Amazon's total recordable injury rate of 7.6 is nearly 36 percent higher than the latest industry totals of 5.6 in 2021. Although Amazon told CNBC it prefers to be compared only to warehouses that employ more than 1,000 people. But SOC says in the 2022 facility level data just released, more than half of Amazon's warehouses reported average annual employment under 1,000 workers. 
We know that it's affecting thousands of workers and it's very alarming. Bobby Gosfiener is one of those thousands. CNBC was introduced to him and three current Amazon workers through a variety of workers' rights groups and labour coalitions. 
Not one human Amazon employee said anything about, hey, Bobby, how are you doing? What can we do to help you? Gosfiener was getting off lunch break in December 2020 when a conveyor belt stopped working properly. Totes were all over the place. It looked like a tornado came through and it was just scattered everywhere. 
He started rushing to get things off the ground so they wouldn't keep piling up. This went on for a good four and a half hours. My pain started in the middle of my right side of my back because we were twisting, moving, downstacking, upstacking totes at a rapid pace. 
I met up with my manager again and I said, hey, I think I'm hurt. I probably need to be seen. And he said, well, I'll tell you what, he's telling me that it's going to take lots of paperwork, lots of paperwork, lots of paperwork. 
He's like, you think you can go take some Advil and put some ice on it and come back? And I was like, yeah, sure, I can do that. I couldn't move my right arm. I drove home with left hand only. 
I moved around with my left hand only in my house. I woke up that next morning in pain, very bad pain, about three or four in the morning. And I was like, I can't do this. 
Gosfiener was diagnosed with a herniated disc. He had surgery five months later and was eventually awarded permanent partial disability as part of his worker comp suit. He can no longer work at Amazon or any other physically strenuous job. 
I have to live with this injury for the rest of my life. I don't get royalty for having a plate and four
screws in my neck because it could have been prevented. I've had herniated discs in the low back and the pain is excruciating. 
It's actually hard to communicate to someone who's never felt it how disabling it is. Biomedical engineering professor Laura Panette has researched occupational ergonomics for some 40 years. She explains the type of musculoskeletal injuries that have Amazon in the federal spotlight. 
Many of them are back and shoulder injuries, which are exactly what you would expect from jobs where there's a lot of lifting and carrying. There are hand and wrist problems occurring and those appear to be related to a lot of repetitive gripping of the hands. It was this sharp, shooting, like stabbing pain like somebody had, you know, cut into that nerve in my wrist. 
Jennifer Crane started at Amazon two years ago to make ends meet when she became a single mom overnight to seven sons after her husband died suddenly of a heart attack. She moved closer to her sister outside St. Louis, and two of her sons took jobs at the same Amazon warehouse a week after she did. And if y'all are coming with me, you gotta have a job. 
Here you go. I did not know what we were getting ourselves into at the time. Crane's injury happened in October. 
She still works at Amazon packing single item boxes. I had to pack at the rate of 80 packages an hour, no matter how small, how big, how heavy. And I was packing a case of sparkling water repetitively all day, along with dog food and Gatorades. 
But went to pack it, felt, you know, pain in my wrist. It shot to my elbow, up to my fingertips. Went to the doctor. 
They put me on fight duty. Took them three weeks to get an MRI that showed a torn ligament. Took me another like two weeks to see an orthopaedic. 
He says, it's not work related. Go back to work. So Amazon sent me back to work injured, unhealed, and expected to make my rate every day. 
In response to both Crane and Gosfiener's stories, an Amazon spokesperson responded in part that Amazon worked diligently to accommodate both employees and ensure that they had what they needed not only to work safely, but also to recover. Any claim to the contrary is false. Crane says a medical professional on site through Amazon's programme called Amcare gave her ice and over-the-counter pain meds. 
But this is the big, huge, huge, huge thing with Amcare and Amazon. They work through like the company and they are very quick to downplay injuries and, you know, give you an ice pack, tell you to sit down for 15, 10 minutes and go back to work. A worker comp assigned to doctor later determined Crane's injury couldn't be tied directly to her work.
But their orthopaedic doctor says, but there's also arthritis in there. So it's the arthritis in your thumb that is the problem, not the torn ligament. It didn't happen at work. 
It was pre-conditioned. I'm like, my hand never hurt. I didn't even know I had arthritis in my hand. 
It had never bothered me until I got injured. Amazon says it has a robust accommodation process, but Crane chose not to further pursue that or a worker's comp. And it's not just workers casting doubt on Amazon's process for reporting work-related injuries. 
After its inspections last year, OSHA cited six Amazon warehouses for failing to properly report worker injuries. And now federal prosecutors are getting involved too, asking if Amazon engaged in a fraudulent scheme designed to hide the true number of injuries. The Department of Justice's Civil Division is looking into whether Amazon executives made false representations to lenders about its safety record to obtain credit, asking Amazon to produce copies of communications and other documents and make several executives available for depositions. 
In a statement, Amazon told CNBC, Beyond warehouses, Amazon says it's making major progress across all worldwide operations, some 1.5 million employees, telling CNBC its total recordable injury rate went down nearly 24 percent from 2019 to 2022. I don't dispute that their injury rates may have gone down some over a period of time, but it's still not good enough. Regardless of whether an injury was indeed caused by workplace hazards, any employee can file an anonymous complaint with OSHA. 
In response, OSHA is required by law to send inspectors, unannounced, to find out what's really going on at the site. These workers were exposed to significant ergonomic hazards. They did not have in place proper procedures to make sure that workers were getting help when packages were over 50 pounds. 
In one facility, I believe it was Florida, we saw materials stacked more than 30 feet high directly where workers were functioning. So there was a likelihood of packages falling over and injuring these workers. Amazon is appealing the citations. 
But if they're upheld, it'll have to pay its first-ever federal fines for worker musculoskeletal injuries. So far, they total nearly $152,000. The Washington State DOJ fines add an additional $81,000. 
But Amazon is also one of the world's only companies to reach a trillion-dollar valuation. There's no amount of money that the Labour Department can impose as a penalty that's going to make a difference to a company that runs through billions of dollars a day. What matters is, are they going to respect the need for their workers to be safe? Amidst federal scrutiny and bad press, Amazon has doubled down on its commitments to do better. 
It's made similar promises in the past. This year, Amazon's promising to spend $550 million on safety initiatives. In his last letter to shareholders as CEO in 2021, Jeff Bezos said he wanted
Amazon to become Earth's safest place to work. 
Soon after, Amazon set a goal of reducing total recordable injury rates 50% by 2025. By the end of 2021, Amazon said it ruled out its Working Well safety and injury prevention programme to all U.S. sites, which includes wellness services and physical, mental and nutritional support for employees, things like stretching before shifts. Many wellness programmes focus on encouraging employees to change their personal behaviours. 
So these might be stretching your arms and legs before you go to work or having a more nutritious diet. But they don't directly address the causes of the injuries in the workplace. Amazon has implemented other changes to directly address hazards, and in 2020, Amazon's injury rate improved from the year before. 
But when the 2021 data came out last year, Amazon's injury rate had jumped back up. An Amazon spokesperson pointed to the pandemic rush as a reason 2021 injury rates were higher across the warehousing industry as a whole and not just Amazon. In a statement given to CNBC, Amazon said it scaled operations significantly to meet unforeseen demand and deliver essential goods to customers. 
This meant we onboarded newer, less-tenured employees. If this was about a bump in the road because of 2021, then presumably Amazon's going to be able to resolve these issues quickly, and we welcome that. Pushing for time. 
The mistakes is going to happen. Injuries are going to happen. 60-year-old Lenita Hammonds is one of the workers Amazon hired in 2021. 
She took a leave of absence in June to have surgery on her left shoulder for an old injury. A couple months after she returned, she says a processing associate threatened to write her up or possibly fire her if she couldn't get her rate back up. When that pain hits me so hard, I can't get that rate up. 
And since the surgery, my shoulder's not getting any better. We're trying to stick it out for that retirement, which is next year when I turn 62. If any employee is struggling with productivity, Amazon says it offers a lot of coaching opportunities to help. 
In a statement, Amazon also told CNBC, we have more work to do. It says it employs more than 8,000 safety and health professionals. And in June, it committed to work with the National Safety Council on reducing musculoskeletal injuries by 25 percent by 2025. 
MSDs like tendonitis, back strains, sprains, carpal tunnel are the leading type of worker injury far beyond Amazon, impacting nearly one in four people globally. Amazon said some of the ways it's mitigating the risks include job rotations, stretching groups called huddles, regular reminders at employees' workstations about taking breaks, and engineering advancements that reduce the need to twist, bend or reach. These advancements include things like redesigned ladders and sort conveyors that bring items closer to workers and height-adjustable
tables. 
Back in Missouri, Crane says those adjustable tables would have helped prevent her wrist injury. Tables had probably been able to adjust. I would have had less strain on my wrist. 
Robotics are one big addition Amazon's made to alleviate worker strain in some warehouses. Mechanical arms help lift heavy packages or do repetitive tasks such as lifting and moving containers. Driving units lift and carry inventory to workers, reducing the need for extra steps. 
Overhead scanners with computer vision are replacing handheld scanners in some warehouses, freeing up both hands for some workers. Amazon also says it's spending $66 million to fit forklifts with collision avoidance technology that uses LiDAR to prevent accidents. For Gosfiener, he wishes he'd spent more time training on the mezzanine level where the conveyor belt malfunction led to his injury. 
Amazon says Gosfiener did take more than 56 training courses, including on the conveyor belt process. Proper training at every point that that conveyor belt moves product and make sure that those people are using good body mechanics and the rate is at a steady pace and not a higher rate pace. In the last year, Amazon has started evaluating body mechanics and exertion using wearable tech, belts or wristbands, to make sure employees are doing things like bending and lifting properly. 
Even as Amazon commits to making improvements, it's also spending significant time and resources to fight back against OSHA's findings, with appeals out for all citations. Unfortunately, in almost the entire country, as long as the company is appealing it, is challenging it, they don't have to fix it. So some workers are taking action, trying to organise and form unions like the one that succeeded a year ago in a Staten Island warehouse. 
Crane is circulating a petition at her warehouse asking for a lower pace of work, more breaks, ergonomic changes and equipment updates. But she says Amazon's high turnover rate is getting in the way of gathering signatures. People can't take it no more and they leave. 
As long as they have new people, they don't know that they can push back and stand up for what's right. Turnover rates at Amazon are high, more than double the industry average, according to some reports, with only a third of new hires staying longer than 90 days per leaked internal documents from 2021. Although Amazon says those documents were just drafts. 
They literally are just going to go and try to find another job because they don't want to deal with this, this constant rat race. The safety is very much backseat to the speed of your work. You have to make sure these rates are met, otherwise you're going to be getting a write up. 
You're not going to be getting any opportunities to switch positions or move up at all. Daniel Olayiwola, who's worked at Amazon since 2017, introduced an unsuccessful resolution at last year's shareholder meeting. It asked Amazon to stop tracking workers' rate of work and time
off task, what Amazon now calls idle time. 
I was asking for them to end this because of the fact that it is a big contributor to the amount of injuries we get. At Amazon's worldwide, I can hands down say that, like, if you're rushing, you're going to make mistakes and someone's going to get hurt. An Amazon spokesperson pointed out that pace of work isn't referenced in any of OSHA's citations. 
But the Southern District of New York's investigations at six warehouses called out the pace of work as an issue. And three states, New York, California and Washington, have passed legislation that seeks to curtail the use of productivity quotas in Amazon warehouses. Olayiwola primarily works driving a forklift through what's called very narrow aisles in his Amazon warehouse in San Antonio, Texas. 
I could be picking up bed frames, dressers, mirrors, like really heavy items, really oblong, awkward shaped things that could be hanging out of the aisles too, which is a dangerous thing. So like the lowest rate we have is like 22 an hour, meaning you'd have to pick an item every three minutes. Olayiwola's wife is pregnant with their second child. 
He also wants to help change Amazon from the inside. He now hosts a podcast called Surviving Scamazon. Why not walk away? Because I have to do it for my kids. 
I gotta be able to support them. I have bills to pay. I know. 
Why don't I look for another job? Yes, I could do that. But right now I'm in the fight to try to make it better there for everybody. OSHA says ergonomic investigations are currently underway at 10 more Amazon sites, with broader investigations pending at dozens more. 
And we're certainly going to be doing follow up as a result of these inspections to make sure that the hazards that we've put Amazon on notice for are addressed. And I would not encourage anybody to work for Amazon. I hate to this day even to order through Amazon because it's so convenient. 
But every time I look at a box, I think of the process of what went through it and who got hurt in the midst of it.
